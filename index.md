## Current projects
### EGate – Biometric Device & Hardware Integration
- Support field deployments at airports, lead vendor debugging sessions, and represent the team in technical integrations. 
- Develop WPF applications (MVVM) for integrating biometric sensors, gates, cameras, and custom controller hardware.  
- Build .NET modules that interface with native SDKs using **P/Invoke**, implementing event driven, state machines.  
- Design plugin mechanisms for loading device capabilities and configurations cleanly.  
- Implement interprocess communication using **Named Pipes** and structured messaging for coordination between services.  
- Improved an internal data streaming pipeline for biometric modules, resulting in speedup for image data transfer.  
- Added an IPC oriented variant and packaged it as an internal NuGet library with message framing and streaming (async) support.

## Prior Projects
### Embedded & EE Projects
- Firmware development for biomedical sensing on Atmega162 (temporal precision, PDM sequencing, BLE, protocol design).  
- Wireless knee health sensing system prototype using STM32. 
- Class D amplifier - FPGA modules implementing communication interfaces (I2S, I2C, SPI), filtering, and digital PWM.  
- Hardware accelerated DSP operations using C++ with AVX2 intrinsics.  
- Customized NIOS II soft processor for optimized filtering tasks.

### Personal Projects
- Custom packet protocols and networking algorithms (sliding window, routing, TCP and UDP transport).  
- Simulation work in Python: RNG analysis, numerical methods, molecular dynamics, and complexity analysis.
- Raspberry Pi NAS configured headlessly via OpenMediaVault.
- Small games (Pacman, UNO server-client) demonstrating MVC, networking, and clean architecture.
